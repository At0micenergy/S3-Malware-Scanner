# S3-Malware-Scanner
Malware Scanner for AWS S3-Bucket
The automated malware scanner leverages AWS serverless architecture, primarily utilizing AWS Lambda functions for event-driven processing. When a user or developer uploads files to the AWS S3 bucket, an AWS Lambda function is triggered. This Lambda function initiates a Docker container running the ClamAV antivirus engine. The Python code within the container interacts with the S3 API to retrieve and scan the uploaded objects. Depending on the scan results, two pathways are implemented: if malware is detected, the file is isolated, and an alert is triggered through AWS CloudWatch; if the file is clean, it is released for production use. The alert is then sent via AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) to relevant stakeholders
